          <img src="images/phoenix.jpg" alt="Phoenix City" width="150" />
          Changed to inherit so it can be modified in the CSS without having to 
          change it here or risk bugging the image in older browsers or firefox 
          (it can not do gradients so I do not trust it haha).

              The Guide Image Is Like This. 
              The directions wanted it to be a linked name after source "Source: Joe Cook"
              Which doesn't seem to make the minimum citation requirements for Rio Salado (media type, credit, location).
              I do not want issues with Grades or "Plagarism". So i hope this is okay I took this liberty
